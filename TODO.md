# TODO

- [ ] implement a [toast?](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_toast.php) to indicate that a new url has been loaded
- [ ] implement a checkbox (with text box?), that allows for the most recent x to be prioritized
- [ ] center align?
- [ ] programmatically determine last conference?
  - get talks[0] and parse the url! (will work until format changes)
  - ~~could get current year, get current month and backup until 4 or 10 is reached using use day.js?~~
    - no! 'cause early October there won't be a new conference list and it will error out!
- [ ] move the source link to the same 'row' as the disclaimer (two columns?)
