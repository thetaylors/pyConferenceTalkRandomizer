# pyConferenceTalkRandomizer

Generates a static webpage that when loaded creates a link to a talk given in a General Conference session of
[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference)

The page will randomly (50/50 chance) pick a talk from a list of talks given at the most recent conference (dynamically
generated from the full list) or from all conferences (since April 1971).
